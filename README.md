#### In one sentence describe what your program will do once completed.
Our program will allow users to subscribe to a stock and set a stock value at which they will be notified via email. 

#### With your group, choose a programming language. What language are you using and why?
We are going to use TypeScript for the frontend and RESTful API call. And then we are going to use Python for the email notification. 
This is because we are more comfortable with TypeScript for frontend and python for the other needs.
