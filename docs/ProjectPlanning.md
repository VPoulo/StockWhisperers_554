# Project Planning & Scope

> 1. Brainstorm a list of features that you'd like the finished product to have. You are not expected to finish all, or even most, of the features you come up with. The goal is just to come up with some fun ideas that you can work towards. Add a docs folder to you repository and include this list as a markdown file.

- User can access website portal
- User can select target price (buy or sell) to be notified for
- User can update the target price
- Users can unsubscribe from notifications.
- User can create an account and log into the system with password
- User can select stocks using search bar using stock symbol
- User can see the end of day market price in their account
- User has a dashboard (once logged on) and can see overview of stocks being watched.
- Account that has current list of stocks selected and user targets
- User sees detail listing of stock, including symbol, name, price, and daily fluctuation

> 2. Define the MVP (Minimum viable product) for your project. Out of your list of features select the most important subset. You will be expected to complete implementation of this list so try to keep the set of tasks manageable. Aim for something that you think can be completed in 2-4 weeks. Include the resulting list in your docs directory.

- User can access website portal
- User can select target price (buy or sell) to be notified for
- User can update the target price
- Users can unsubscribe from notifications.

> 3. For each of the features that are to be included in the MVP, create one or more User stories. You'll estimate these tasks as part of your first sprint, so you don't need to be too precise yet, but try to keep them small. Any story that will take more than a week should be broken into multiple smaller stories if possible. Follow the user stories guidelines discussed in lecture. To track these user stories we'll be using GitHub Issues. Create an Issue for each user story in your project. All group members must create at least one user story.

> 4. Discuss the overall structure your project will have. It's a good idea to break the project into several files in order to simplify the process of multiple people contributing to the project.

- Subscription Form (TypeScript)
- Buttons  - subscribe & unsubscribe (TypeScript)
- Radio Buttons - buy or sell (TypeScript)
- Landing Page - combines components and design of website (TypeScript)
- REST API for Website to update database (TypeScript)
- Call Stock API and update database (Python)
- Email Script  (Python)
